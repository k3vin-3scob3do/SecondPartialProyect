Monster-Battle
Small arcade-style battle game, which is adapted to a leveled story mode. The player will have the opportunity to select a character of his choice, and then play and fight with him. This game uses turn-based action, so the player must perform an action, then wait for the other character to act, then act again, until the end of the level or else lose the level.  The game is designed to run on the terminal, implementing a small variety of sprites that will act as the characters.
